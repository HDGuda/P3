How to play the Frogger game

To start the game open the index.html in your browser. The game starts automatically.

The player's aim is to move the avatar across the street without being hit by the ugly bugs. The avatar can be moved with the arrow-keys. Directions are up, down, left and right.

Whenever the player succeeds in crossing the street and reaching the river the next level starts and points are added to the player's score which is displayed in the upper left corner of the canvas. 

Whenever the player's avatar is hit by a bug the level restarts, the player looses a life and some points are deducted from the score. When the player lost all three lives the game is over. When the score gets below zero the game ends as well.

To restart the game you have to refresh the browser's window.

Have fun with the game and merry Christmas!
